Internet has made the barrier of creative career path even lower. Nowadays, everyone can post their content on platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to label themselves as content creators. I personally want to be a YouTuber several years ago. Although those great videos posted on YouTube seem to be easy and effortless, when I was making it myself, I could really felt the difficulty in it. As an individual creator, it’s hard to imagine the effort behind the work. So as an audience and consumer, I can totally understand the sponsored contents. 

From the podcast, I learned that followers doesn’t necessarily mean profit. People mostly care about the views. And it is super risky to rely on the platform because you don’t when it would end. It’s important to create your own IP(intellectual property) in order to fully control your content. 
	
As mentioned by one speaker in the podcast, “creativity and business should work together”. Business has its artist side because  business is a key factor that will make the creativity sustainable. If there’s no way to make money, this won’t be a healthy model. In addition, I totally agree with the last speaker who works as both a writer and a publisher. He is very practical about his work. He said working at the publisher can support him as a writer. As long as the model works, it’s a great way to produce creative work.

## Week 1 reading response
In the article “The man who made Justin Bieber”, I learned a lot secrets behind Justin Bieber’s fame, and how he became world-wide famous. Although I grew up in China, I can still remember his song “Baby” was so popular that almost everyone was singing and imitating him. 

After reading this article, I found that Braun was a great businessman who is good at predicting the trend and using resources wisely. When the CD industry was starting to decline, he quickly gear toward the digital music industry and started using digital media to promote Justin Bieber. Also, he let Bieber continue posting videos in a certain way instead of letting him perform with other famous singers immediately after he discovered Bieber on YouTube. I found this decision really wise because he had to gather certain amount of fans online in order to promote him to a wider audience. And Internet is a perfect platform to gain fame quickly. 

Braun is also good at cross-promotion. He used Bieber’s fame to benefit other clients and it worked quite well. For instance, “Last month, he tweeted to introduce the world to Braun’s newest client, Madison Beer, a thirteen-year-old singer who resembles a baby Megan Fox. Within minutes, her name was trending worldwide”. Such strategy made Braun’s success like a snowball, continuously promoting new clients. 

While being a successful businessman, Braun was strict with his clients. For instance, when Bieber was late for a performance, Braun immediately called Bieber and yelled at him. Then he would point out his fault and “have somebody come to his house every workday”.
