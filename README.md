## Week 2 reading response
Internet has made the barrier of creative career path even lower. Nowadays, everyone can post their content on platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to label themselves as content creators. I personally want to be a YouTuber several years ago. Although those great videos posted on YouTube seem to be easy and effortless, when I was making it myself, I could really felt the difficulty in it. As an individual creator, it’s hard to imagine the effort behind the work. So as an audience and consumer, I can totally understand the sponsored contents. 

From the podcast, I learned that followers doesn’t necessarily mean profit. People mostly care about the views. And it is super risky to rely on the platform because you don’t when it would end. It’s important to create your own IP(intellectual property) in order to fully control your content. 
	
As mentioned by one speaker in the podcast, “creativity and business should work together”. Business has its artist side because  business is a key factor that will make the creativity sustainable. If there’s no way to make money, this won’t be a healthy model. In addition, I totally agree with the last speaker who works as both a writer and a publisher. He is very practical about his work. He said working at the publisher can support him as a writer. As long as the model works, it’s a great way to produce creative work.
